for creating this project use visual studio sofware.
downlod and install visual studio in system.
create file or emport file . after that your actual work start.
make some conditional operation that shows diffrent results according to user's response.
that concept should be work as predefind conditions. for example id user type the keyword which is predefind by admin then it gives a answer according to the game else system give a single error message every time till did't get the right keyword.
in my case at wrong keyword it shows . you are not allowed to exit untill all tasks will not complete.
